## Introduction

IBM Cognos [@fa18-523-81-cognosintro] is a business intelligence suite that can help users to provide powerful insights to drive better business decisions. Business intelligence is an all-encompassing term that includes tools, infrastructure and applications that help in analyzing, evaluating and visualizing data. With help of BI software, one can envision relationships within the data that help organizations make knowledgeable business decisions. Using business intelligence tools, organizations can integrate their data and create reports, dashboards, metrics and scorecards to gain insights. 
Business intelligence suites by definition need to incorporate techniques like data processing, data modelling, querying, visualizing among other things. IBMs Cognos Business Intelligence is one among the many suites that has an extensive set of options ranging from exploration, modelling and querying to data visualization. The Cognos BI suite has multiple components including report studio, event studio, metric studio, framework manager, workspace among many others.

## History

Cognos was a consulting and performance management company that was founded in 1969. It was acquired by IBM into its Infosphere product line in 2008 when companies like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft were fighting to become leaders in the BI market. In 2005, the company had released its Cognos 8 suite which introduced tools such as the Report studio, Query studio, Analysis studio and many others. After the acquisition by IBM, IBM Cognos 10 was released that had the capability to incorporate SPSS predictive analytics, historical and real-time analysis, better, faster and more flexible way of generating reports and dashboards. The next version of Cognos was the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence 10.2.2 that had the ability to integrate Microsoft Office with Cognos [@fa18-523-81-history].
The latest edition of Cognos is the IBM Cognos Analytics 11.0 which is a state-of-the-art Analytics tool. This version of Cognos is a very powerful BI tool with ability to connect to Hadoop, an in-built AI assistant and smart data-discovery

## Architecture

### IBM Cognos Connection

IBM Cognos Connection is a web-based user interface that is used to access various cognos services such as Query Studio, Report Studio, Analysis Studio, Metric Studio etc. Using IBM Cognos connection one can access all the available reports and perform different operations such as create, run, schedule and access the reports. The admin has the ability to set up access permissions, manage data sources and provide individual and group memberships with in the interface. Users can personalize the connection as per their choice.

### IBM Cognos Insight

Insight [@fa18-523-81-insight] is an individual entity with-in the Cognos family that incorporates a range of analytic abilities like ad-hoc querying and analyzing what-if scenarios. It is very user-friendly since one can perform data analysis, do off-hand querying, create dashboards with utmost ease. It’s almost like tableau where you can drag and drop the data files and insight automatically creates crosstabs and charts using something called smart metadata. Insight has the ability to create natural hierarchies between the data it receives to create OLAP cubes which makes it easier for the users to slice and dice the data as they prefer. Insight also comes with write back functionality that provides the ability to create models using prior data or new data that the user provides. 

### IBM Cognos Workspace

Workspace [@fa18-523-81-workspace] is a web-based tool that can be used to create interactive dashboards known as workspaces using existing or new reports with in the IBM Cognos connection.

It contains widgets and filters that users could use while creating the dashboards. 

### IBM Cognos Workspace Advanced

Business Intelligence is an area with a lot of options to choose from i.e. which studio, which data package etc. Most of the Cognos BI users are perplexed about the time wasted in navigating between different studios. Cognos Workspace Advanced was designed to bridge the gap between various studios. With the advent of Cognos Workspace Advanced, the redundancy of having three different studios is clearly noticed [@fa18-523-81-workspaceadvanced]. The advanced Cognos was designed in a way that it can amalgamate all the services on one platform where the users can use multiple services at the same time. It provides a single interface for querying and analysis and is very flexible in terms of presentation options.

### IBM Cognos Report Studio

Report Studio [@fa18-523-81-reportstudio] is a report composing instrument that proficient report creators and designers use to fabricate complex, various page reports against numerous databases. It’s the most used component in the IBM Cognos Business intelligence suite. With Report Studio, you can make any reports that your association requires. Report Studio offers a variety of services such as creating and formatting report using grouping, headers, footers, and other formatting options. Report Studio also enables focusing reports by filtering data and using prompts. The report studio also aids in adding value to the reports by performing different manipulations. It enhances the visual appeal of the reports though advanced formatting and exceptional data highlighting. 

### IBM Cognos Event Studio

The Cognos Event Studio [@fa18-523-81-eventstudio] is predominantly used to keep track of the events in an organization to ensure that the decision-makers are notified of the upcoming events to make timely and effective decisions. An event is generally a situation that can create some impact on the business. When there are significant changes in the data, an event is detected to be taking place and agents are placed within this framework to detect the occurrence of events in organizational data. The sole purpose of an event studio is to notify the decision-makers about an event which is otherwise inconspicuous. When these agents are activated by the changes in data, the activation gets passed as notification to for further action such as sending an e-mail, adding information to the portal and running reports.
